# video-lab guide

Build → Cast → Shoot → Generate → Cut. Open a starter on the home page: some include finished media and a cut, while others focus on blockouts with selected generated showcases. If blocking changed, media may be marked "older". See the [starter inventory](../examples/starters/README.md), or create an empty scene. For a bounded review, follow [first use](first-use.md). The in-app **Guide** has interactive examples; opening it never edits a project or starts a generation.

![Home and starter projects](../public/guide/home.webp)

## 1. Build

Block out the people, vehicles, props and set with simple 3D objects.

- Right-click or press **Shift + A** to add an object, then name it.
- Drag empty space to orbit, right-drag to pan and scroll to zoom. Click selects; Shift-click adds to the selection; Shift-drag draws a selection box.
- **G / R / S** move, rotate and resize. **X / Y / Z** constrain an axis; type a number and press Enter to confirm. Escape cancels.
- **Ctrl/⌘ + G** groups selected objects. Click again inside a selected group to edit a piece.
- Press **I** to set a key at the playhead, move later in the shot, move the object and set another key. Preview to see the motion.

![Build: scene and object controls](../public/guide/build.webp)

## 2. Cast

Give objects cast images so their appearance carries between shots.

- Open an object and upload or drop an image, or request an image from its description.
- A design sheet shows the same design from several views. Pick the image you want to use for the object.
- The app gathers cast images for objects visible in the shot. Review the actual inputs before approving a request: models accept different inputs and counts.
- Make a still to check the shot's composition and appearance before making a video.

The in-app guide compares the grey blockout with this Breaking News still and shows the cast images used.

![Breaking News still](../public/guide/breaking-news-s2-still.webp)

## 3. Shoot

Pick a shot, frame its subject and preview the camera move.

- Set **distance, height, angle and lens**, then choose a move. The information button beside Move previews it.
- **Preview** plays the shot. **C** looks through the shot camera.
- **Fly camera** records a take using the keyboard, gamepad or phone. Keep the take to use it as camera keys.
- Keyboard flight: W/S forward/back, A/D sideways, Q/E turn, Space/Shift up/down, arrows aim, Alt slows, R records and Escape releases.

![Shoot: shot camera and settings](../public/guide/shoot.webp)

See [gamepad](gamepad.md) for the gamepad layouts and [phone setup](director-phone.md) for pairing over local HTTPS. The guide includes keyboard, gamepad and phone diagrams.

## 4. Generate

Make the grey blockout, then ask a video model to turn it into the shot.

- **Make blockout** captures the shot camera on your computer for free. If you change the shot, make the blockout again.
- Choose a video model. Some models follow a clip; others animate from one or two stills and do not see the full camera move.
- Review the inputs, where the model runs and the estimated cost. Paid work needs explicit approval; opening the guide never approves anything.
- Inspect the result against the blockout. A still is typically a few cents and a five-second video about a dollar, but the estimate for your selected model is the one to check.
- Change things freely: an output goes out of date only when something it is made from changes (the camera, timing, an object its frames can show, its prompt, a cast image, its model or seed). Hover a badge for why; **Pin** a take in the Take lab to keep it; a batch makes only what changed ([regeneration](regeneration.md)).
- **Edit region…** (Take lab) regenerates a fixed painted crop of an eligible silent 1280×720 / 24 fps / 81-frame take on Comfy Cloud (Wan VACE 14B), then composites locally; outside-mask pixels are checked against the original before encoding (the saved MP4 is lossy). The edit attaches as its own take; it does not become the cut until you mark it. The quote is a planning estimate, not a provider bill cap.
- Set a budget so a busy day cannot run away: `PREVIS_BUDGET_CAP_USD` (account, per month) and `PREVIS_BUDGET_PROJECT_CAP_USD` (per project). Paid work over a cap is refused before it is sent, the Jobs panel shows what is left, `pnpm usage:report` shows what was actually billed and `pnpm usage:settle` compares it with the ledger (README, Configuration). Estimates include reference images and the paid grader, and reservations add `PREVIS_BUDGET_MARGIN` (10% by default); a dry-run batch shows each part.

### Stills that match the blockout

Storyboard stills (key frames) get three things so the image keeps the blockout's camera and blocking:

- **A guide frame (image 1)** rendered in a guide look: vehicles get bright headlights, a pale nose and windscreen and red tail lights; people get a pale face and shoes; a light ground grid, a light sky (dim indoors) and shadows near the shot. Labels never appear. The workspace viewport and blockout videos look as before.
- **The camera in words**, measured from the scene through the shot camera: move and moment, lens, shot size, camera height and angle, which side of the subject we see, the horizon, and each visible object's place, size, crop and heading ("nose pointing screen-right: a flat side profile… front end cut off by the right edge"). The composer shows it under the inputs.
- **Fewer cast images**: looks of objects actually in frame, one environment image and the previous shot's last still, labelled as design-only so their pose doesn't override the guide. The shot's subject and the cast its description names (@handle) always send their look while in frame, even far away: a hero car 70 m down the track is still the hero.
- **The moment**: a start still is told it shows the first instant (the action is only beginning), an end still the last. The shot text describes the whole action and on its own pulls a start still to the climax.

A still remembers the blocking it was made from. When the shot changes (camera, timing or any object's position), a batch makes that key frame again rather than handing a video the old layout; the plan says "Blocking changed since its key frame; made again". Stills made before this was recorded count as changed when the shot's blockout clip is newer than them. Uploaded frames are always kept.

**Exact frames.** A blockout is 24 fps: a 5 s shot has frames 0–119, and **End** is frame 119 (4.958 s), the last frame the clip shows, not 5.000 s. The storyboard playhead snaps to a frame (**+ Still at frame 60**), and a still records its frame, is made from that frame's guide and is graded against it. Stills made before this show **≈frame** (an older End was made at the shot's full length). The track marks the key frames: **S**, **E** and ◆ for each in-between frame, green when current, amber when the shot has changed since (out of date stills are never sent), outlined when there is no still yet.

**Key frame roles.** Start → end models get the newest take at the first and last frame. **Use as start / Use as end** on a mid-shot still makes it the start or end instead; it is marked with its frame and goes out of date with the shot like any still. **Pin as in-between** sends a still as a timed in-between frame, offered only for a model that takes one: of the built-in models, only **Kling 4.0 · start → end stills** (up to 8, from the Comfy Cloud node's `middle_frames` input). Kling spaces them evenly, so the storyboard and the quote show where each lands and which frames land exactly. Other models take a start and an optional end frame and list pinned in-between frames as not sent. Claude does the same with `previs_director_keyframe` (see a frame's guide, make a still there, pin it, list what a model takes).

**FLUX 3** follows the blockout best on side profiles and people and is the storyboard default; **Nano Banana 2.1** also follows it well, phrased as an edit of image 1, but tends to turn side profiles into chase angles. On head-on and going-away vehicles it is the other way round: FLUX 3 reversed a car or split the field with a wall (graded 5), and Nano Banana 2.1 matched (9); GPT Image 2.5, the final tier's still model, also matched (9). See `.evidence/stillmatch-20261030/RESULTS.md` and `.evidence/hero-20261030/HERO.md` in the integration checkout.

**Match check.** With `PREVIS_MATCH_GRADER=gemini` (and paid generation on), each new key frame is graded 0–10 for camera and blocking by Gemini 3.5 Flash on Comfy Cloud ($0.01 reserved per graded still, an upper bound, counted in the still's quote, reservation and batch estimate; about 20 s before the still attaches). The storyboard shows "matches blockout N/10", and a batch with `retryWeakMatch: true` redoes a still graded below 6 once with FLUX 3 (or Nano Banana 2.1 if it was FLUX 3), charged to the batch budget. Without the flag a free local edge-and-light score is stored with `rough: true`; it did not track camera match on hand-labelled stills, so it is never shown as a match score and never triggers a retry.

### Models

List prices are Comfy Cloud estimates from each node's live price badge (checked 2026-10-30). The app quotes every request before you approve it; reference-image surcharges and Cloud overhead are not included.

**Video** (start-still models animate the shot's Start still; start → end models also pin its End still, and without one fall back to the start-only model at the same price):

| Model | Comfy node | Takes | Clip lengths | ≈ List price |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LTX 2.5 Fast (draft) | `LtxApi25ImageToVideo` | start still | 2–10 s | $0.13/s (720p) |
| LTX 2.5 Pro | `LtxApi25ImageToVideo` | start, or start → end | 2–10 s | $0.17/s (720p) |
| Seedance 2.5 | `ByteDance2ReferenceNodeV2` (start still as reference image 1; may reframe), `ByteDance2FirstLastFrameNode` | start (as reference), or start → end | 4–10 s | $0.33/s (720p, token-billed) |
| Kling 4.0 | `Kling4ImageToVideoNode` | start, or start → end | 3–10 s | $0.22/s (720p) |
| Veo 3.1 | `Veo3VideoGenerationNode`, `Veo3FirstLastFrameNode` | start, or start → end | 4, 6 or 8 s | $0.20/s (720p, no audio) |
| MiniMax Hailuo H3 | `MinimaxHailuo03FirstLastFrameNode` | start, or start → end | 4–10 s | $0.13/s (768p) |
| Wan 2.7 | `Wan2ImageToVideoApi` | start, or start → end | 2–10 s | $0.10/s (720p) |
| Seedance 2.5 · edit | `ByteDance2ReferenceNodeV2` (edit) | blockout clip | clip length, 4–30 s | $0.40/s (720p) |
| Kling O1 · edit | `KlingOmniProEditVideoNode` | blockout clip | 3–10 s | $0.13/s (720p) |
| Wan VACE 1.3B (local) | `WanVaceToVideo` | blockout edges | as set | local GPU |

**Images** (looks, design sheets and stills; "refs" counts cast images besides a still's blockout guide):

| Model | Comfy node | Refs | ≈ List price |
|---|---|---|---|
| Flux.2 [pro] (draft) | `Flux2ImageNode` | 7 | $0.03 |
| Flux.2 [max] | `Flux2ImageNode` | 7 | $0.07 (+ $0.03–0.24 for refs) |
| FLUX 3 | `Flux3ImageNode` | 9 | $0.07 |
| Flux 1.1 [pro] Ultra | `FluxProUltraImageNode` | guide only | $0.06 |
| GPT Image 2.5 (Sunburst, high) | `OpenAIGPTImageNodeV2` | 9 | $0.06–0.08 (+ ≈ $0.015 per ref) |
| Seedream 5.0 Pro | `ByteDanceSeedreamNodeV3` | 9 | $0.045 |
| Nano Banana Pro | `GeminiImage2Node` (refs padded and batched) | 9 | $0.16 |
| Nano Banana 2.1 / 2 | `GeminiNanoBanana2V2` | 9 | $0.05 / $0.08 |
| Local checkpoint | `CheckpointLoaderSimple` | guide only | local GPU |

Batch tiers: **draft** uses Flux.2 [pro] images and LTX 2.5 Fast video; **final** uses FLUX 3 looks and sheets, GPT Image 2.5 stills and Seedance 2.5 · edit video, which follows the blockout clip (set in `shared/tiers.mjs`). A batch sends every shot's stills before design sheets, so videos start as early as possible.

### Camera comes from the blockout

The blockout is the source of truth for camera motion. A video prompt never describes the move ("truck right", "low angle"); it carries one line that names the input to follow, plus lens and filter hints. Movement and cut tags are notes for you and stay out of the prompts.

Each video model takes its camera from one of three sources, shown on the Video-model card, the batch plan and each version in Cut:

- **Blockout** (Kling O1 edit, Seedance 2.5 edit, Wan VACE): the blockout clip itself is the video input, so your move is the camera. The start and end stills follow as the look, then the cast images. A blockout that is older than the shot is made again first. The final tier uses this.
- **Start → end stills** (LTX 2.5 Pro, Seedance 2.5, Kling 4.0, Veo 3.1, MiniMax Hailuo H3 and Wan 2.7 start → end): the model moves between stills made from the blockout's first and last frames. It only approximates the move in between.
- **One still** (the start-still models, including LTX 2.5 Fast in the draft tier): the model animates a single still and guesses the camera. The card marks this as approximate.

Which blockout model, from the three launch hero shots (a head-on pass with a whip pan, a dunk with a push-in, a slow orbit; `.evidence/hero-20261030/HERO.md`):

- **Seedance 2.5 · edit** held the blockout camera on all three, including a pass 3 m from the lens, and is the final-tier default. It needs a 4–30 s blockout clip (a shorter one is refused at plan time) and returns a clip about 0.3 s shorter than the input.
- **Kling O1 · edit** is a third of the price but dropped the fast pass's camera (it became a side-on tracking shot) and started a dunk from its look still instead of the run-up. Use it for slower moves and drafts.
- **LTX 2.5 Pro start → end** is the cheap control: it made a strong car-ad pass between two matched stills, but the eagle's wings flailed and the dunk jumped between its two stills.

### Shots where the subject's direction matters

Some routes keep which way the subject faces and travels; others turn it around. On the 2026-11-01 Wingspan regens the start-still and start → end routes (FLUX stills → LTX 2.5 Fast and LTX 2.5 Pro) and Kling O1 edit with look images turned the eagle to face the lens, while the blockout has it flying away. Seedance 2.5 edit of the blockout clip kept it seen from behind on all three shots. The Video-model card therefore shows each route's **blockout fidelity** next to its camera source: what the route takes (*Edits the blockout clip*, *Blockout clip as control frames*, *Start + end stills + text* or *Start still + text*) and how well it kept direction (*Follows blockout direction*, *Direction sometimes lost* or *Direction is a guess*). The picker shows the same label for every model. These labels are a heuristic from a handful of judged takes, not a measurement.

A shot is **direction-critical** when you tick **Motion/direction-critical shot** on the card, or when its blockout subject faces away from the camera for most of the shot, turns 60° or more, or travels four or more of its own lengths. The facing comes from the 3D scene, so a camera that chases the subject still counts. For a direction-critical shot the card explains why, recommends the route that kept direction (Seedance 2.5 edit when the clip is 4–30 s; Wan VACE on your own ComfyUI otherwise) and offers **Switch to …**. A critical shot with no saved model starts on it. Nothing is blocked: any model can still be chosen. Claude sees the same thing. `previs_director_models` lists `blockoutFidelity` per model, `previs_director_shot_inputs` and `previs_director_model_settings` return `directionAdvice`, `previs_director_generate_video` without a model picks the recommended route for a critical shot and says why, and a batch dry run puts `directionAdvice` on each critical shot's video when the tier's model may lose direction. The flag is `update_shot` `motionCritical: true`.

**Direction check.** With `PREVIS_MATCH_GRADER=gemini` and paid generation on, **Check direction** on a video take in Compare takes (or `previs_director_grade_take`) samples four moments, from 15% to 90% through the clip. It sends the take's frames as one image to the same Gemini grader as stills, which reports per moment which side of the subject it sees and which way it faces and travels. It then compares those with the blockout, measured from the 3D scene. If the scene has changed since the clip was rendered, the blockout's frames are sent as a second image and read too. The take gets **Pass**, **Warn** (a quarter turn off, or the subject not readable in most moments) or **Fail** (facing or travelling the other way at any moment) with a reason, e.g. "At 2.0 s the Bald eagle faces the camera; the blockout has it facing away." A check books one grader charge, $0.01, in the budget ledger, and the take shows that ledger entry's amount (billed once `pnpm usage:settle` matches it). The check judges direction only, not framing, identity or artefacts. On the regen takes it failed the two that face the lens (Kling O1 The valley, LTX 2.5 Fast The dive) and passed the three accepted Seedance edits. It also passed Kling O1 The dive and LTX 2.5 Pro The dive, which were rejected for framing and for dissolving mid-shot; in their frames the eagle is seen side-on or from behind, not facing the camera. Look at the frames before you pick a winner.

Write the description as action and look only ("@comfy-car dives to the inside and blows past to take the checkered flag by a full car length"); the blockout supplies the camera, and the stills the composition.

**Look medium.** A blockout model's prompt ends with the camera rule: follow the blockout clip exactly and repaint it photoreal in the look of the still. When the shot's format or look section, or the project style, names another medium (anime, claymation or stop-motion, watercolour, stylised 3D animation, oil painting, pixel art, comic-book art, cartoon, pencil drawing), the rule repaints it in that medium and never says photoreal. The Gemini still models' edit rule and every still's closing rule do the same (`lookMedium` in `shared/camera-source.mjs`). Photoreal prompts are unchanged. A new look is a new video prompt, so the shot's videos read **inputs changed**.

## 5. Cut

Choose the versions, order and timing of the film.

- Drag shot rows to reorder them.
- Choose a version for each shot and trim its in/out times.
- **In cut** includes or leaves out a shot. Compare blockout and generated video by dragging the seam or using the arrow keys.
- **Compare takes** opens the shot's takes: every video it has made (Take 1 is the oldest), and its stills at each moment. Tick 2–4 to see them side by side, with the blockout as an optional reference lane. Videos play, pause, scrub and step frame by frame together (Space, ← →); a shorter take holds its last frame. Each take shows its model, settings and seed, cost, inputs and grades. Layout is graded only when the paid still grader ran; direction (video takes) only after **Check direction** ran (see above); identity is not assessed; timing compares frame counts with the blockout. **Only differences** keeps just what differs. **Mark winner** makes a take the one the cut and film export play, and a newer take never replaces it. Choosing a take in the version menu does the same. No take is deleted. Through Claude: `previs_director_list_takes`, `previs_director_grade_take` and `previs_director_set_winner`.
- Preview the sequence, then **Export film** to write an MP4 in shot order. Project export separately keeps the editable project and its media together.

![Cut board: order, version, trims and export](../public/guide/cut.webp)

## Library: reuse objects across projects

Save a cast member or a set piece once and place it in any project on this computer.

- Select the object and choose **Save to library** under Appearance. Give it a name (its @handle) and a few tags. A group saves with everything inside it.
- The asset keeps the description, style notes, primary cast image and each finished design sheet. If the object shares another object's image, that image and description are copied into the asset. Animation and shot images are left behind.
- In another project, open **Library → Shared assets** and choose **Place**. The object lands 2 m in front of the shot's subject, selected, and Undo removes it. Through Claude: "put @red-racecar at the start line". An @handle names an object in the scene when one has it; otherwise Claude looks in the library.
- Saving the same object again, or a placed copy of it, makes the next version; older versions stay in `library/assets/<id>/versions/`. Nothing in the library is deleted by the app.
- **Export** writes one `<handle>.previs-asset.zip` to share. **Import asset…** in the Library dialog, or **Import…** on the home page, adds one to your library. An asset you already have with the same content is left unchanged; new content becomes its next version.

## Other ways to work

You can direct the same project through Claude using the MCP connector; see the [README setup](agent-setup.md). A shot built in Blender can become a shot's blockout, with its camera, objects and rendered frames; see [Import a Blender shot](blender-import.md). Phone aiming requires local HTTPS and a trusted certificate. The public demo is read-only; generation needs a local installation.

## Guide media and maintenance

The shipped examples live in `public/guide/`; `manifest.json` records their source project, shot, asset and capture time. URLs in the app respect the deployment base, including GitHub Pages. See [guide integration and capture](guide-integration.md) for the capture command and the module APIs.

Older review packs and checkpoints are historical engineering notes, not current user instructions. See [the historical document index](history/README.md).

### Posing blockout characters

Bundled players, anchors and operators have simple rigid-part joints; eagles have wings, feather tips and a tail,
elk have a neck pivot, and race cars have steering, wheels and a sprung body. These are low-poly animation guides.
Use `previs_director_animate` or agent `set_keyframes` edits to pose them:

```json
{"object":"Comfy guard","keys":[
  {"t":0,"pose":{"armR":[-25,0,0],"forearmR":[-45,0,0]},"ease":"smoothstep"},
  {"t":1,"pose":{"armR":[-150,0,0],"forearmR":[-12,0,0]}}
]}
```

`pose` maps joint names to local XYZ degrees. Supported names are `body`, `head`, `armL/R`, `forearmL/R`,
`thighL/R`, `shinL/R`, `wingL/R`, `tipL/R`, `tail`, `steerL/R`, and `wheelFL/FR/RL/RR` (expand `L/R` to `L`
or `R`). Unsupported joints on a particular model do nothing. Pose angles blend without wrapping, so a wheel
can turn through 720°. An empty pose `{}` returns all joints to rest; missing joints in a pose mean rest.
Omitting pose from a transform key leaves the pose track alone. `update_entity` can also set a static `pose`
(`null` clears it). The keyframe tools accept at most 64 keys, in scene seconds, shared across shots.

An outgoing key's `ease: "linear"` gives constant segment speed; `"smoothstep"` eases to and from rest without
overshooting. Omit it to keep the existing position spline. Pose, rotation and scale default to linear blending.
Use linear keys for a moving car or the middle of a jump, and smoothstep for a hand settling onto the desk.
The viewport, thumbnail stills, browser video capture and headless renderer evaluate the same pose. Pose keys
and the posed model ID change the blocking signature, so earlier stills/videos of shots that show the posed object become out of date ([regeneration](regeneration.md)).
